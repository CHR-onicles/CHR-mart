- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I really enjoyed practising CSS grids with this one, I also got to use Sass for the first time while following its 7-1 architecture which made things really convenient for me.

I learnt how to integrate libraries like Owl Carousel with JQUERY into my work and modify some of its components.
